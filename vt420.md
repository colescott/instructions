This file contains instructions for using a DEC VT420, particularly on
macOS 10.12. This file was typed on a VT420.

# THE KEYBOARD

The LK201 is awful. Typing on it for more than a few minutes will make
your hand hurt. The keys are mushy and difficult, and the caps-lock
key doesn't differentiate itself from the 'A' key.

Unfortunately, the keyboards use a proprietary protocol and interface,
so you don't have many options. The best I've found so far is the
LK402. The keys are noticeably better and the right side of the
caps-lock key is sufficiently differentiated from the 'A' key.

The situation with the 'alt' key is pretty dire. Don't expect to be
using it.


# CONNECTING TO A MODERN COMPUTER

I use an FDTI-drivered USB-to-serial cable, because the Mac has native drivers for these. There are at least two variants of the VT420 that I own:

1. The "international" edition

2. The "North American" edition.

The international edition contains a convenient DB25 port on the
back. To connect to this port, you need the following chain:

```
USB-to-DB9 (male) <--> (female) DB9-to-DB25 (female) null modem
                  <--> (male) DB25 port on VT450
```

The North American edition doesn't have a DB25 port (or a removable
power cable!) and requires one of these special MMJ cables along with
special MMJ adapters. Here, I use:

```
USB-to-DB9 (male) <--> (female) DB9-to-DB9 (male) null modem
                  <--> (female) DB9-to-MMJ (female) DEC H8571-B
                  <--> (male) MMJ-to-MMJ (male)
                  <--> (female) MMJ port on VT450
```


# VT420 SETTINGS

Pressing F3 will get you into the menu. I suggest wiping it to factory
default first, and then changing the settings. We go through the
settings pages one-by-one.

## Global

Here you'll set up which port you're using. This is important on the international edition, where you should set 'S1=Comm1' and 'Comm1=RS-232'.

## Display

Set the display how you'd like. I'm OK with 80x24 myself, but you
might want something different. Do change scrolling to "Jump Scroll"
and don't make your cursor blink.

## General

- Set mode to VT400 Mode, 7 Bit Controls

- Use 8-Bit Characters

- I use UPSS ISO Latin-1

- ID as VT420.

## Comm

This is maybe the most important section if you want to get
connectivity with your computer.

- Transmit = 9600
- Receive = Transmit
- No XOFF
- 8 Bits, No Parity
- 1 Stop Bit
- Data Leads Only

## Printer

Nothing of note. Do you really want to be taking "screenshots" of your
terminal to a line or dot matrix printer?

## Keyboard

Mostly user preference here.

- Make `~ read as ESC.

- Make <> read as `~.

- Make the key click low.

- Disable F2

- Remember that shift-, and shift-. give you your beloved <> in case
  you've forgotten because you're using an LK201 keyboard.

## Tab

Nothing of note here.


# FIND THE SERIAL DEVICE

Run

    ls /dev | grep usb

and you should find something like `cu.usbserial-*` or
`tty.usbserial-*`. Whatever it is, remember it, because that's the
device we will be talking to. (You'll probably have both. Prefer the
`cu.*` variant.)


# TESTING CONNECTIVITY

To test connectivity, you'll want to use `screen` or, on a Mac,
CoolTerm.

    screen /dev/cu.usbserial.xxx 9600 cs8 ixoff -L

After running this, you should be able to type in your virtual
terminal and have the characters show up on the real terminal. If they
don't, that suggests there's an issue with the physical
connection. Make sure you have a null modem in the loop, as suggested
above. You can't just gender-change through this one!

To get out of screen, do `C-a-\ y`.


# STARTING A SESSION ON THE TERMINAL

Now that we've established connectivity, we can start a session. We
need to set some things up on the Mac side.

The usual way to start a session is to use `getty`. Mac doesn't allow
this unless it is within a launch daemon.

Create a file

    /Library/LaunchDaemons/serial-console.plist

and in it put the following

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>serial-console</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/libexec/getty</string>
        <string>std.9600</string>
        <string>cu.usbserial-A9080MNN</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Note the string with `cu.usbserial-*`. Put whatever you got in there.

The `std.9600` will be looked up in `/dev/gettytab`. If you have
additional customization, put it there, but don't modify `std.9600`,
just make a new entry.

Once you have this file (which you'll needed to have made as root)

    chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/serial-console.plist
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/serial-console.plist
    sudo launchctl start serial-console

Now you should have an active terminal on your VT420.


# CONFIGURING THE SHELL

You'll want to tell your shell about your terminal personality (from
termcap/terminfo database). You can do this by exporting
`TERM=vt420`. Exporting an earlier compatible term is also fine, like
`TERM=vt220`.


# TODO ITEMS

- TODO: Figure how to configure automatically.
- TODO: Talk about `stty rows <R> cols <C>`
- TODO: Figure out locale.
- TODO: Figure out special purpose Emacs configuration.
- - paredit, Shift-modifiers, etc.
- - detecting the terminal


# TROUBLESHOOTING

The one hiccup I ran into following online tutorials was adding and
using an entry from `/etc/gettytab`. I discovered from the system.log
that the process was exiting with failure upon trying to launch
getty. This is why, above, I've opted to just use a standard entry
from gettytab instead of my own.
