This file contains instructions for using a DEC VT420, particularly on
macOS 10.12. This file was typed on a VT420.

# THE KEYBOARD

The LK201 is awful. Typing on it for more than a few minutes will make
your hand hurt. The keys are mushy and difficult, and the caps-lock
key doesn't differentiate itself from the 'A' key.

Unfortunately, the keyboards use a proprietary protocol and interface,
so you don't have many options. The best I've found so far is the
LK402. The keys are noticeably better and the right side of the
caps-lock key is sufficiently differentiated from the 'A' key.

The situation with the 'alt' key is pretty dire. Don't expect to be
using it.


# CONNECTING TO A MODERN COMPUTER

I use an FDTI-drivered USB-to-serial cable, because the Mac has native
drivers for these. There are at least two variants of the VT420 that I
own:

1. The "international" edition
2. The "North American" edition.

The international edition contains a convenient DB25 port on the
back. To connect to this port, you need the following chain:

```
USB-to-DB9 (male) <--> (female) DB9-to-DB25 (female) null modem
                  <--> (male) DB25 port on VT450
```

The North American edition doesn't have a DB25 port (or a removable
power cable!) and requires one of these special MMJ cables along with
special MMJ adapters. Here, I use:

```
USB-to-DB9 (male) <--> (female) DB9-to-DB9 (male) null modem
                  <--> (female) DB9-to-MMJ (female) DEC H8571-B
                  <--> (male) MMJ-to-MMJ (male)
                  <--> (female) MMJ port on VT450
```


# VT420 SETTINGS

Pressing F3 will get you into the menu. I suggest wiping it to factory
default first, and then changing the settings. We go through the
settings pages one-by-one.

## Global

Here you'll set up which port you're using. This is important on the
international edition, where you should set 'S1=Comm1' and
'Comm1=RS-232'.

## Display

Set the display how you'd like. I'm OK with 80x24 myself, but you
might want something different. Do change scrolling to "Jump Scroll"
and don't make your cursor blink.

If you want to use the largest setting possible, 132x48, then you will
need to change both of the respective settings, as well as the "pages"
setting to "3x48 pages". If you don't make this last setting, then
your terminal will only work for the upper half (24) lines of the
screen.

## General

- Set mode to VT400 Mode, 7 Bit Controls
- Use 8-Bit Characters
- I use UPSS ISO Latin-1
- ID as VT420.

## Comm

This is maybe the most important section if you want to get
connectivity with your computer.

- Transmit = 19200
- Receive = Transmit
- No XOFF
- 8 Bits, No Parity
- 1 Stop Bit
- Data Leads Only

## Printer

Nothing of note. Do you really want to be taking "screenshots" of your
terminal to a line or dot matrix printer?

## Keyboard

Mostly user preference here.

- Make `~ read as ESC.
- Make <> read as `~.
- Make the key click low.
- Disable F2
- Remember that shift-, and shift-. give you your beloved <> in case
  you've forgotten because you're using an LK201 keyboard.

## Tab

Nothing of note here.


# FIND THE SERIAL DEVICE

Run

    ls /dev | grep usb

and you should find something like `cu.usbserial-*` or
`tty.usbserial-*`. Whatever it is, remember it, because that's the
device we will be talking to. (You'll probably have both. Prefer the
`cu.*` variant.)


# TESTING CONNECTIVITY

To test connectivity, you'll want to use `screen` or, on a Mac,
CoolTerm.

    screen /dev/cu.usbserial-xxx 19200 cs8 ixoff -L

After running this, you should be able to type in your virtual
terminal and have the characters show up on the real terminal. If they
don't, that suggests there's an issue with the physical
connection. Make sure you have a null modem in the loop, as suggested
above. You can't just gender-change through this one!

To get out of screen, do `C-a-\ y`.


# STARTING A SESSION ON THE TERMINAL

Now that we've established connectivity, we can start a session. We
need to set some things up on the Mac side.

The usual way to start a session is to use `getty`. Mac doesn't allow
this unless it is within a launch daemon.

Create a file

    /Library/LaunchDaemons/serial-console.plist

and in it put the following

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>serial-console</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/libexec/getty</string>
        <string>std.19200</string>
        <string>cu.usbserial-A9080MNN</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Note the string with `cu.usbserial-*`. Put whatever you got in there.

The `std.19200` will be looked up in `/dev/gettytab`. If you have
additional customization, put it there, but don't modify `std.19200`,
just make a new entry.

Once you have this file (which you'll needed to have made as root)

    chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/serial-console.plist
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/serial-console.plist
    sudo launchctl start serial-console

Now you should have an active terminal on your VT420.


# CONFIGURING THE SHELL

You'll want to tell your shell about your terminal personality (from
termcap/terminfo database). You can do this by exporting
`TERM=vt420`. Exporting an earlier compatible term is also fine, like
`TERM=vt220`.

For some easy setup with the terminal as 132x36, run

```
source vt420.sh
```

provided in this directory. This also sets the locale to ISO8859-1.


# EMACS

Emacs has a special-purpose facility for loading terminal-specific stuff. Here are some notes.

## Loading Terminal-Specific Nonsense

If your terminal is set by `$TERM`, then Emacs will try to `load` a
file named `term/$TERM.{el,elc}`. However, aliases that Emacs has seem
to supersede the `$TERM`. It turns out that the variable
`term-file-aliases` contains these, and it sets the alias `vt420` as
for `vt200`. Therefore, to make terminal-specific stuff, either remove
this alias and create the file `term/vt420.el` or keep the alias and
create the file `term/vt200.el`.

You can detect whether you're in a non-graphical terminal in Emacs by
doing:

    (setq in-terminal (not window-system))

## Emacs Tips

Don't load any of the fancy color theme stuff you might have. That can
both confuse the terminal, as well as make it much slower (because it
has a lot more to interpret).

## Things That Don't Work

- The alt key doesn't work.
- Scrolling down using arrows causes a lot of garbled text for
  me. Maybe a flow control issue? I also notice Emacs tries to
  smooth-scroll in the terminal? `C-v` works fine.
- A lot of key commands don't work (probably because the terminal
  doesn't know how to send them). For example:
- - `C-right`, `C-)`
- - `C-_` (use `C-/` instead; it's also easier anyway!)


# TODO ITEMS

- TODO: Figure how to configure automatically.
- TODO: Figure out special purpose Emacs configuration.
- - paredit, Shift-modifiers, etc.
- TODO: Figure out the numpad on the LK400-series keyboard.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

The one hiccup I ran into following online tutorials was adding and
using an entry from `/etc/gettytab`. I discovered from the system.log
that the process was exiting with failure upon trying to launch
getty. This is why, above, I've opted to just use a standard entry
from gettytab instead of my own.
